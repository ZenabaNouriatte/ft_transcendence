Objectives
This project is a surprise.
As you are reaching the end of your Common Core, you have developed strong adap-
tation and problem-solving skills. This project will confront you with -maybe- unknown
technologies, intentionally. Once again, you will have to adapt, discover, explore, exper-
iment to create the expected software.
The project includes a mandatory part and a series of modules on various topics, as
detailed below in this subject. You will be able to choose the modules you want among
a large list, but each module and mandatory element contains technical constraints you
cannot bypass. So you can select the topics you like, but not technologies you like. This
is a deliberate pedagogical choice.
This project is not intended to be a portfolio for an incoming internship or other pro-
fessional experience. Its purpose is to reveal your ability to become acquainted with and
complete a complex task using an unfamiliar technology. This situation will inevitably
be faced during your career, and we aim to develop your self-confidence in front of such
situations.
Especially on this big and long project, we encourage you to carefully read the en-
tire subject, consider several possible strategies, think about your design, before starting
coding anything! Some modules may depend on others, some modules may conflict with
others. Ft_transcendence will bring many doubts and requires a lot of difficult decisions!
Act wisely :-)
Also, this project is definitely a long run, and a wrong path will lead you to a huge loss
of time. Your project management and team management choices will strongly impact
your timeline and results. Many approaches and tools exist to support you on these topics.
Good luck, and have fun playing Pong!

Chapter III
Mandatory part
This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!
III.1 Overview
Your software will offer a nice user interface and real-time multiplayer capabilities allowing
to play Pong with all your friends!
•At first, your project needs to adhere to the mandatory guidelines as a minimum
requirement (see next section), which will represent only a small portion to the final
grade.
•The second part of this subject will offer additional modules that can replace or
complement the mandatory part.
In this subject, you will face words that are highlighted in green. They represent
technology choices that will evolve over time. Be sure to pay close attention to the
version of the subject.
•The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or a module is
prohibited.
•Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
•The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple, unique
task representing a subcomponent of a larger feature or module,
is allowed.
•During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project
guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project’s
constraints.
•During the evaluation, the evaluator will take responsibility
for determining whether the use of a specific library or tool
is legitimate (and allowed) or if it essentially solves an
entire feature or module (and is therefore prohibited).

III.2 Minimal technical requirement
Your project must comply with the following rules:
Some of these constraints may be overridden by the choice of specific
modules.
•You are free to develop the site, with or without a backend.
◦If you choose to include a backend, it must be written in pure PHP without
frameworks. However, this requirement can be overridden by the Framework
module.
◦If your backend or framework uses a database, you must follow the constraints
of the Database module.
•The frontend should be developed using Typescript as base code. However, this
requirement can be modified through the FrontEnd module.
•Your website must be a single-page application. The user should be able to use the
Back and Forward buttons of the browser.
•Your website must be compatible with the latest stable up-to-date version of
Mozilla Firefox . Of course, it can be compatible with other web browsers!
•The user should encounter no unhandled errors or warnings when browsing the
website.
•You must use Docker to run your website. Everything must be launched with a
single command line to run an autonomous container.
Several container technologies exist: Docker, containerd, podman,
etc. On the computers of your campus, you may access the container
software in rootless mode for security reasons. This could lead to
the following extra constraints:
•Your runtime needs to be located in /goinfre or /sgoinfre.
•You are not able to use “bind-mount volumes” between the host
and the container if non-root UIDs are used in the container.
Depending on the current requirements of the subject (highlighted in
green above) and the local configuration in clusters, you may need to
adopt different strategies, such as: container solution in virtual
machine, rebuild your container after your changes, craft your own
image with root as unique UID.

III.3 Game
The main purpose of this website is to play Pong versus other players.
•Users must be able to participate in a live Pong game against another player directly
on the website. Both players will use the same keyboard. The Remote players
module can enhance this functionality with remote players.
•A player must be able to play against another, and a tournament system should
also be available. This tournament will consist of multiple players who can take
turns playing against each other. You have flexibility in how you implement the
tournament, but it must clearly display who is playing against whom and the order
of the play.
•A registration system is required: at the start of a tournament, each player must
input their alias. The aliases will be reset when a new tournament begins. How-
ever, this requirement can be modified using the Standard User Management
module. Note: This does not imply user account creation.
In the default (mandatory) version, users simply enter an alias manually.
•There must be a matchmaking system: the tournament system should organize
the matchmaking of the participants, and announce the next match.
•All players must adhere to the same rules, including having identical paddle speed.
This requirement also applies when using AI; the AI must exhibit the same speed
as a regular player.
•The game must adhere to the default frontend constraints (as outlined above), or
you may choose to use the FrontEnd module, or override it with the Graphics
module. While the visual aesthetics can vary, the game must still capture the
essence of the original Pong (1972).

•The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or module is
prohibited.
•Any direct instruction regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
•The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple,
unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature
or module, is allowed.
•During the evaluation, the team will justify any use of a
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the project
guidelines and is not in contradiction with the project’s
constraints.
•During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the
use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed)
or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is
therefore prohibited).
•The tournament system must work with or without user
registration.
◦Without the Standard User Management module: users
manually input an alias.
◦With the module: aliases are linked to registered
accounts, allowing persistent stats and friend lists.
The module extends the tournament logic; it does not replace
it.

III.4 Security concerns
In order to create a functional website, there are several security concerns you must
address:
•Any password stored in your database, if applicable, must be hashed.
•Your website must be protected against SQL injections/XSS attacks.
•If you have a backend or any other features, it is mandatory to enable an HTTPS
connection for all aspects (use wss instead of ws for example).
•You must implement validation mechanisms for forms and any user input, either on
the base page if no backend is used, or on the server side if a backend is employed.
•Regardless of whether you choose to implement the JWT Security module with
2FA, it’s essential to prioritize the security of your website. For instance, if you
choose to create an API, ensure your routes are protected. Even if you decide not
to use JWT tokens, securing the site remains critical.
Please make sure you use a strong password hashing algorithm
For obvious security reasons, any credentials, API keys, env
variables etc., must be saved locally in a .env file and ignored
by git. Publicly stored credentials will cause your project to fail.

Chapter IV
Modules
Now that you’ve accomplished 25% of the project, congratulations!
With a functional basic website in place, the next step is to choose modules for fur-
ther improvement.
To achieve 100% project completion, a minimum of 7 major modules is required.
It’s crucial to carefully review each module as it may require modifications to your base-
line website. Therefore, we strongly recommend reading this entire subject thoroughly.
•The use of libraries or tools that provide an immediate
and complete solution for an entire feature or module is
prohibited.
•Any direct instructions regarding the use (can, must, can’t) of
a third-party library or tool must be followed.
•The use of a small library or tool that solves a simple,
unique task, representing a subcomponent of a larger feature
or module, is allowed.
•During the evaluation, the team will justify any usage of
library or tool that is not explicitly approved by the subject,
and that does not contradict the subject’s constraints.
•During the evaluation, the evaluator will determine whether the
use of a specific library or tool is legitimate (and allowed)
or if it essentially solves an entire feature or module (and is
therefore prohibited).
Two Minor Modules count as one Major Module.
